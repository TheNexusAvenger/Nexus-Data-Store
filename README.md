# Nexus-Data-Store
Nexus Data Store is a successor to PlayerDataStore by stravant.
Nexus Data Store provides the same functionality of buffering
DataStore requests with the addition of cross-server communication
for changes using the `MessagingService`. Assuming proper listening
using `OnUpdate`, data of players in a game can be manipulates from
other servers within 2 seconds of the server making the change.
